# Internet of Things (IOT) Project for Raspberry Pi

## Sensors:
1. DHT11 - Basic Temperature and Humidity Sensor
2. BMP180 - Barometric Pressure, Temperature and Altitude Sensor
3. DS18B20 - One-wire Digital Temperature Sensor
4. HC-SR501 - Adjustable PIR Motion Detector Sensor

## Services:
1. Adafruit IO - The Internet of Things for Everyone (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io)
2. Initial State - Data Analytics for the Internet of Things (https://www.initialstate.com/)
3. Node-RED - A visual tool for wiring the Internet of Things (https://nodered.org/)

## Programming:
1. Python 
2. Node.js

Source code is arranged in folders, e.g. "Python" contains all .py scripts, and "Node.js" contains .js etc.
Circuit diagrams are in "Circuits" folder with "*_bb.png" files as
